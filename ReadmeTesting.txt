To perform testing using the Jest code for React Native, follow these steps:

1. Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
Navigate to your React Native project root directory and install the necessary testing dependencies:
     ```
     npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react-native jest-expo @react-navigation/native
     ```

2. Create a test file:
Create a new file named `Screen.test.js` in the same directory as your `Screen.js` component.

3. Write Jest Test Cases:
Write the Jest test case code into the `Screen.test.js` file.

4. Run Tests:
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to execute the Jest tests:
     ```
     npm test
     ```

5. View Test Results:
Jest will run the test cases and display the results in the terminal.
If all test cases pass, you should see a green checkmark indicating successful tests.
If there are any failures, Jest will display relevant error messages to help you identify the issues.
